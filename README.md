# Python Photomosaic

This repository generates a photomosaic via python and opencv.<br>
For a startup idea I followed [FuturProgrammer360](https://github.com/futureprogrammer360) and his [Walkthrough YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/BRZN-GF4esU).
I've extended the idea and created an extra repository to make the algorithm more extensible and the program more adaptable.


## TO DOs
 - ouput directory of used images for fast analyzation
 - parallelize tile selection for faster results
 - adjust caching to output tile size for better results
